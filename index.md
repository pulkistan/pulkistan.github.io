The Republic of Pulkistan has a long and varied history, however on the 1st of November, 2017
the father of our nation, Sri Naveen Singh, bought our republic into spotlight by reciting
our national anthem:

> Malayaam, subrata jyotsam, **pulkistan**, sumita, dumala Tsunamim, suhasin, sumandra bhulsumanee
